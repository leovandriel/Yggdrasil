Yggdrasil
===========

*Objective-C quadtree implementation with OS X visualization app.*


About
-----
Yggdrasil turns a simple 2D mapping into a quad tree by recursively sampling coordinates. It can be used for generating a fast lookup for country codes based on a slow lookups like polygon intersection or even web requests.

Labeler
-------
Yggdrasil builds up its quadtree by sampling labels from a *labeler*. A labeler provides a mapping from 2D coordinates to string labels. All labelers implement the `YGLabeler` protocol, which includes the method:

    - (void)labelAtPoint:(NSPoint)point block:(void (^)(NSString *))block;

The `NSPoint` parameter is contained in the rectangle returned by `- (NSRect)rect`. The callback block allows for asynchronous lookup, for example to fetch labels from a web server.


Drawing
-------
When selecting a labeler, the last fully scanned quadtree is displayed. After starting a scan, progress is indicated by frequent updates and the display of a white square cursor. Zoom in by clicking one of the four quadrants, zoom out by clicking on the side. The tree is only drawn up to screen resolution, so use zooming to appreciate the details. Resize the window to have the cursor update more frequently, small is fast.


Caching
-------
All sampled labels are stored in cache file to allow fast reruns of the same labeler. This cache is stored in `~/Caches/Yggdrasil` with a `.cache` extension, which is JSON data. 

When the labeling completes, the quadtree is stored in the same folder with a `.ygg` extension. The format of this file is derived from the JSON format, and contains nested arrays with four elements. Each array represents a tree node and can contain both sub-arrays and labels. The tree leafs are string labels.

Element are ordered left to right, bottom to top. For example:

    +-------+-------+
    | C | D |       |
    +---+---+       |
    | B |   |       |
    +-------+-------+
    |       |       |
    |       |   A   |
    |       |       |
    +-------+-------+

is encoded as:

    [,A,[B,,C,D],]
    

Demo
----
Demo Ruby code is included to demonstrate the lookup process in a generated quadtree:

    ruby lookup.rb 52 5
    
The included world geo data is of low accuracy. If you're looking for more details, then use the `world-12.ygg` file located in the `Demo` folder. This tree was generated using a 11 MB GeoJSON file. The tree has a maximum depth of 12, minimum 10 and subsample 2. It took about 4 hours of scanning on a 2 GHz Core i7 and resulted in a 130 MB cache file. The result is 630 KB, or 100 KB gzipped, with an accuracy of 10 km around the equator (40,000 / 2^12).


Geodata
-------
The `YGGeoJsonLabeler` class relies on the file `world.json`, which is included in this project. This file contains [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) data that was downloaded from [github.com/johan/world.geo.json](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json).

More geo data can be found here:

Use [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) to convert formats. On OS X this can be installed with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Example usage:

    ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON world.json world.shp
